        <p>Respected Sir,</p>
        <p>I am student of your college. My name is Madhabi Hazra.I could not come to college because
            of my health issue. I am extremely sorry, and I assure you that I will follow the college
            rules.<br>For now, I request you to please wave off the imposed fine. I also assure you that
            you will find me more punctual in the future. I hope you understand my problem and gave me a 
            favor.
